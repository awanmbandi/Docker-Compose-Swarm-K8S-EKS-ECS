## Step-01: Introduction to ReplicaSets
- What are ReplicaSets?
- What is the advantage of using ReplicaSets?

## Step-02: Create ReplicaSet

### Step-02-01: Create ReplicaSet
- Create ReplicaSet
```t
# Kubernetes ReplicaSet
kubectl create -f replicaset-demo.yml
```
- **replicaset-demo.yml**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-webapp-rs
  labels:
    app: nginx-webapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-webapp
        image: nginx:latest
```

### Step-02-02: List ReplicaSets
- Get list of ReplicaSets
```t
# List ReplicaSets
kubectl get replicaset
kubectl get rs
```

### Step-02-03: Describe ReplicaSet
- Describe the newly created ReplicaSet
```t
# Describe ReplicaSet
kubectl describe rs/<replicaset-name>

kubectl describe rs/my-helloworld-rs
[or]
kubectl describe rs my-helloworld-rs
```

### Step-02-04: List of Pods
- Get list of Pods
```t
# Get list of Pods
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Get list of Pods with Pod IP and Node in which it is running
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

### Step-02-05: Verify the Owner of the Pod
- Verify the owner reference of the pod.
- Verify under **"name"** tag under **"ownerReferences"**. We will find the replicaset name to which this pod belongs to. 
```t
# List Pod with Output as YAML
kubectl get pods <pod-name> -o yaml
kubectl get pods my-helloworld-rs-c8rrj -o yaml 
```

## Step-03: Expose ReplicaSet as a Service
- Expose ReplicaSet with a service (Load Balancer Service) to access the application externally (from internet)
```t
# Expose ReplicaSet as a Service
kubectl expose rs <ReplicaSet-Name>  --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=<Service-Name-To-Be-Created>
kubectl expose rs my-helloworld-rs  --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=my-helloworld-rs-service

# List Services
kubectl get service
kubectl get svc
```
- **Access the Application using External or Public IP**
```t
# Access Application
http://<External-IP-from-get-service-output>/hello
curl http://<External-IP-from-get-service-output>/hello

# Observation
1. Each time we access the application, request will be sent to different pod and pods id will be displayed for us. 
```

## Step-04: Test Replicaset Reliability or High Availability 
- Test how the high availability or reliability concept is achieved automatically in Kubernetes
- Whenever a POD is accidentally terminated due to some application issue, ReplicaSet should auto-create that Pod to maintain desired number of Replicas configured to achive High Availability.
```t
# To get Pod Name
kubectl get pods

# Delete the Pod
kubectl delete pod <Pod-Name>

# Verify the new pod got created automatically
kubectl get pods   (Verify Age and name of new pod)
``` 

## Step-05: Test ReplicaSet Scalability feature 
- Test how scalability is going to seamless & quick
- Update the **replicas** field in **replicaset-demo.yml** from 3 to 6.
```yaml
# Before change
spec:
  replicas: 3

# After change
spec:
  replicas: 6
```
- Update the ReplicaSet
```t
# Apply latest changes to ReplicaSet
kubectl replace -f replicaset-demo.yml

# Verify if new pods got created
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## Step-06: Delete ReplicaSet & Service
### Step-06-01: Delete ReplicaSet
```t
# Delete ReplicaSet
kubectl delete rs <ReplicaSet-Name>

# Sample Commands
kubectl delete rs/my-helloworld-rs
[or]
kubectl delete rs my-helloworld-rs

# Verify if ReplicaSet got deleted
kubectl get rs
```

### Step-06-02: Delete Service created for ReplicaSet
```t
# Delete Service
kubectl delete svc <service-name>

# Sample Commands
kubectl delete svc my-helloworld-rs-service
[or]
kubectl delete svc/my-helloworld-rs-service

# Verify if Service got deleted
kubectl get svc
```
